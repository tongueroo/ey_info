CloudInfo::Instances outline
1. connect to ec2

2. find instances that are in the ey-env
find ey instances from ey-recipes for specific environment
  grab aws_group from one of the instances in the ey-env
  instances in group
  I can simply also just grab the instances from ey-recipes instead of working back from the aws_group..

3. connect to instances (ssh) and build info
connect to servers
download json and store in dictionary lookup
at this point we have enough data about the servers to build up the info we want

4. hosts
{:prod_app0 => 'xx.xx.xx.xx', :prod_app1 => 'xx.xx.xx.xx'}

============
good stopping point:
* figure out a way to test exception from ssh.connect
  * bad password
  * timeout
